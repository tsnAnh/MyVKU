# My VKU
## Caution
My VKU is currently under heavy development. Note that some changes (such as database schema modifications) are not backwards compatible and may cause the app to crash. In this case, please uninstall and re-install the app.
## Getting Started
Clone project using this command

``
git clone https://github.com/tsnanh/MyVKU.git
``

and open project folder using Android Studio.
## Clean Architecture + MVVM
A strong base architecture is extremely important for an app to scale and meet the expectation of the user base.

## Gradle Kotlin DSL
Gradleâ€™s Kotlin DSL provides an alternative syntax to the traditional Groovy DSL with an enhanced editing experience in supported IDEs, with superior content assist, refactoring, documentation, and more.
